# sm64js

## What is this?
This is the start of my project of porting a decompilation of original Nintendo game, Super Mario 64, to native Javascript (No Emulation) (No Web Assembly). This project also required creating a Javascript WebGL port of N64 Fast 3D Renderer originally implemented with OpenGL in C.

## Basic Instructions - TODO
### Use yarn or npm to install modules

### npm run start or yarn start to launch dev server
### npm run build or yarn build to build production code

### node serveProduction.js - tool to simply serve the front end code
